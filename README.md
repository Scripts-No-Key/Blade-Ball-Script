# Roblox Blade Ball Script - GitHub Repository

Welcome to the **Roblox Blade Ball Script** GitHub repository! This script is designed to enhance the gameplay experience in Roblox by providing an engaging and dynamic blade ball mechanic. Whether you're a Roblox developer looking to integrate a unique feature into your game or just someone interested in scripting, this repository has everything you need to get started.

## About the Roblox Blade Ball Script

The **Blade Ball Script** is a custom-built solution for creating a fun and competitive ball game in Roblox, featuring interactive blades that spin and slice. The script allows you to implement the core mechanics of the game, where players can kick, dodge, and interact with a blade-enhanced ball. It can be customized to suit different game themes and modes, from team battles to free-for-all arenas.

## Features

- **Interactive Ball Physics:** The script creates smooth, realistic ball physics that react to player interactions and blade impacts.
- **Blade Interaction:** Blades attached to the ball or players will dynamically spin and slice, adding excitement and strategy to the gameplay.
- **Customizable Settings:** Easily adjust ball speed, blade rotation, and other settings to match the gameplay style of your game.
- **Multiplayer Support:** Fully compatible with Roblox's multiplayer environment, allowing multiple players to join and enjoy the game simultaneously.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** The script is designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions for integration and customization.
- **Optimized Performance:** Built with performance in mind, this script runs smoothly on a variety of devices, ensuring a lag-free experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Roblox Studio installed.
- Basic knowledge of scripting in Roblox (Lua).
- An active Roblox game or project to integrate the script into.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone this repository using the command:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-blade-ball-script.git`
   
2. Open Roblox Studio and navigate to your game project.
3. Drag and drop the script into your game’s `StarterPlayer` or `ServerScriptService` folder.
4. Customize the script parameters (e.g., blade speed, ball properties) to match your game’s needs.
5. Save and run your game to test the new Blade Ball feature.

For a detailed walkthrough, refer to the `InstallationGuide.md` in the repository.

## How It Works

The Blade Ball Script functions by manipulating the **CFrame** and **BodyVelocity** properties of both the ball and the blades. When the ball collides with players or other objects, the script triggers a slicing effect based on the speed and angle of impact. The script also handles the interactions between players and the ball, ensuring seamless gameplay.

## Customization

You can modify several aspects of the game, including:
- **Ball Speed & Bounce:** Adjust how fast the ball moves and how it bounces when hitting surfaces.
- **Blade Rotation:** Control the rotation speed of the blades to make the game more or less challenging.
- **Player Effects:** Add custom particle effects when a player is hit by the ball or blades, increasing visual appeal.
- **Game Modes:** Implement different game modes, such as time-based rounds or point-based scoring.

Refer to the `config.lua` file for all available customization options.
